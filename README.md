# APCSA_Q4-project
This was my final project for my highschool AP Computer science course. I know a lot of the code can be improved, 
but I'm not going to. It's more or less in a working state. in the files there may be remnants of features that were cut because
I ran out of time. The Final winstate was slapped on at the end becuase that was part of the project requirements.

## Build

Build with Gradle

run gradlew build in the root directory

built jar will be in build/libs

---
## Game Controlles

Controls are WASD to move up/left/down/right respectively. The arrow keys work too. SHIFT to sprint ENTER to place bombs
and SPACE to talk to NPCs (they aren't terribly useful like they were supposed to be). 

get 100 coins to win, theres more than enough around.

Feel free to use any code from this you may want as long as credit is provided
